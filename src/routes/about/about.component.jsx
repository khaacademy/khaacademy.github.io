        <h2>What is Kha Academy?</h2>
        <p> Kha Academy is a collection of Mu Alpha Theta practice tests and resources that you can study from! It was made for the future generations at Haynes Academy. Haynes is well-known for their <b>sweeping</b> at local tournaments, and I would like to help Haynes continue this tradition.</p>

        <hr/>

        <h2>How can I help?</h2>
        <p> I've graduated from Haynes, so I will no longer have access to new Mu Alpha Theta tests. If you have a test from a tournament (new or old) that is not on my website, I'd appreciate it if you sent it to my email at khale282819@gmail.com (phone snapshots will suffice). I will upload the test and credit you for it. I am especially lacking in Alpha and Theta content, as I have only participated in Mu. Help the future Mu Alpha Theta of Haynes!</p>
        <p> Also, if you notice any typos or errors on my tests, website, or answers, feel free to email me so I can make corrections.</p>

        <h2>FAQ</h2>

        <h3>What are the Mu, Alpha, Theta levels?</h3>
        <p> <b>Theta</b> covers Geometry and Algebra II.  </p>
        <p> <b>Alpha</b> covers Pre-Calculus.   </p>
        <p> <b>Mu</b> covers Calculus.  </p>
        <p> Some divisions can have specific branches (such as Trigonometry for Alpha) and there can even be middle school divisions. Potpourri is a category consisting of "fun" math.</p>
        <br/>

        <h3>How do I sign up for local Mu Alpha Theta competitions?</h3>
        <p> At Mu Alpha Theta meetings, officers will give updates on upcoming tournaments and should provide forms for students to sign. You typically have to pay $15 for a local tournament.</p>
        <br/>

        <h3>How long are local competitions?</h3>
        <p> Each round tends to last one hour. Tournaments last around 4-5 hours. You can expect a tournament to begin around 8:00 A.M. and end around 1:00 P.M.</p>
        <br/>

        <h3>What happens at a Mu Alpha Theta tournament?</h3>
        <p> The structure is described as below chronologically: </p>
        <p> <b>Welcome</b> - Cheesy opening speech with provided schedule and map for the day.</p>
        <p> <b>Individual</b> - Solve problems on your own.</p>
        <p> <b>Team</b> - Solve problems with a team.</p>
        <p> <b>Interschool</b> - Solve random types of problems with your entire school. </p>
        <p> <b>Award Ceremony</b> - Awards for top three and honorable mentions. Cheer for your classmates!</p>
        <p> Certain rounds can be substituted for other minigames, such as ciphering, math bowl, gemini, descartes, and hustle. (See more details at <a href="http://www.lamao.org/Public/Rules?EventGroup=Games">www.lamao.org/</a>).</p>
        <br/>

        <h3>Are calculators allowed at competitions?</h3>
        <p> You are not allowed to use calculators on most tests. The only exception is at state convention, where you are allowed to use calculators on certain tests, including individual tests. You may still bring one if you would like to check solutions after a round. </p>
        <br/>

        <h3>What should I bring on tournament day?</h3>
        <p> Bring sharpened pencils with a good eraser. Proctors may lend you a pencil, but you may end up with a dull pencil. It is good to come well-equipped.</p>
        <p> You will have enough space for work on most tests, so looseleaf is not needed. </p>
        <p> However, it is common for interschool round to get messy, so bringing looseleaf of your own could be helpful. </p>
        <p> Sometimes before the award ceremony, there are concessions, so consider bringing some money. </p>
        <p> You can bring water and snacks in case there are no concessions.</p>
        <br/>

        <h3>What's the difference between Calculus I, Calculus AB, or Mu A?</h3>
        <p> Calculus I, Calculus AB, and Mu A can almost be used interchangeably. Same can be said for Calculus II, Calculus BC, and Mu B. </p>
        <p> Calculus I, II is the naming convention used in college courses. </p>
        <p> Calculus AB, BC is the naming convention used by CollegeBoard for the AP Exams. </p>
        <p> Mu A, B is the naming convention used by Mu Alpha Theta.</p>
        <br/>

        <h3>What is "Typeset" and "Raws"?</h3>
        <p> Typesetted tests are formatted via \(\rm\LaTeX\) (LaTeX), while raw tests are just how the test exactly appeared on tournament day. In the typesetted tests, not only do problems show up neater and cleaner, but I also fix any grammatical errors or even errors within a problem. Along with this, I remove any invalid questions. Raws are provided if you would like to familiarize yourself with the original test's formatting.</p>
        <br/>

        <h3>What's the difference between Mu Alpha Theta, AP, and AMC?</h3>
        <p> This website prepares you for Mu Alpha Theta mainly, although I do provide some resources for the latter two. Mu Alpha Theta is the math honor society with math competitions usually focused on content with a little bit of problem solving. AP math exams are for college credit and can be taken as part of the high school curriculum. AMC is a math competition that is much more focused on specific types of problem-solving, making it much more difficult than the AP exam or Mu Alpha Theta. </p>
        <br/>

        <h3>My sponsor never announced one of the tournaments listed on the "Dates" section?</h3>
        <p> I list tournaments from the Louisiana State Mu Alpha Theta website. However, depending on the number of sign-ups, the distance, and the Haynes sponsor, Haynes will not necessarily participate in all of these competitions. </p>
        <br/>

        <h3>Can I join a contest even if I'm not in Mu Alpha Theta?</h3>
        <p> Yes! Just turn in the form and let a Mu Alpha Theta officer or sponsor know. However, you may not be able to join the state or national convention.</p>
        <br/>

        <h3>Can I take math tests that are above my level?</h3>
        <p> Yes! For example, if you are taking geometry currently, you are still allowed to take calculus tests. However, you may not sign up for tests below your current level.</p>
        <br/>

        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p> I'm Kha Le, a former student of Haynes Academy! I joined Mu Alpha Theta in my junior year and after my first tournament, I absolutely got hooked. I've placed first place in various divisions in over five local math competitions. I've participated in the state and national competition for Mu Alpha Theta. I've also participated in the AMC, AIME, LSU Math Contest, USMCA, VTRMC, and Putnam. I regret not joining the math scene earlier as I had less experience and access to resources. I made this website in hopes that even newcomers to the math scene will have plenty of resources to study from!</p>
